# Blender Booster Add-on
New add-on for Blender 3D to combine several improvements and functionalities.

Copy / Paste nodes between Shader and Geometry nodes (work in progress). Blender 3.2 latest build required until bug fixes make it back to the current stable release. Otherwise pasting groups from Shader to Geometry will cause a crash.
